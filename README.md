# Building

This is currently set up to use gcc. On Windows, you should install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/), and use that to install gcc.

## Dependencies

Download dependencies from the link below and unzip them into the `lib` folder. Its contents are gitignored so it doesn't pointlessly use up repository space. Make sure to download the correct version of each dependency for your system.

I'll add something to the build step to do this automatically at some point I just haven't got round to it.
