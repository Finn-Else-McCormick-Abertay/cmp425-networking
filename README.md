# Building

Build with CMake 3.28 or later.
The configure step will automatically download any dependencies that it can't find on your system.

(Should work with any compiler, but I've been using Clang for the last third of the project so some unforseen MSVC compatibility issues may have crept in. Probably stick to the pre-built binaries.)
